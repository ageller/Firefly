Volume rendering with 2d projection
-----------------------------------

The Projection tab of the UI allows users to plot a colormapped 2d 
histogram rather than individual points.

This tab contains a checkbox to enable projection, a dropdown selector
to pick the colormap to apply, a checkbox to toggle whether the colormap 
should be applied to the log of the histogram values or not, and a two
handled slider to change the colormap limits.
