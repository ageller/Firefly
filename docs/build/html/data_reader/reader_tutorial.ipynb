    "# Tutorial notebook: Using the `Reader` class\n",
    "One of the main purposes of Firefly is to enable users to interactively explore their *own* data (or else interactively explore someone else's respective own data). While it is possible to format one's data manually using a text editor we have provided a python API for producing the `.json` files that are necessary to run an iteration of Firefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central piece of that API is the `Firefly.data_reader.Reader` class, which acts to collect the different parts of the API together to produce consistently formatted and linked `.json` files that the Firefly webapp can interpret. The `Reader` class is <a href=\"https://ageller.github.io/Firefly/docs/build/html/data_reader/reader.html\">documented here</a> but here we only provide a brief example of how to use the API. "

    "To begin, we'll start by initializing a `Reader` object. Users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the different keyword arguments through the documentation linked above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important keyword argument is the `JSONdir`, which tells your `Reader` object where it should collect the different `.json` files it will produce. The `.json` files have to be readable from the `Firefly/static/data` directory of the iteration of Firefly that's trying to open the data. The `Reader` class will automatically create a shortcut to the directory if you don't choose a path that lives in `Firefly/static/data`. If you enter a relative path it will assume you mean relative to your `${HOME}` directory. If no `JSONdir` is provided then it will default to `${HOME}/<JSONprefix>` (which itself defaults to `Data` if nothing is passed). "
