# firefly_api
The python API for Firefly

This repository contains the _official_ Python frontend for the (soon-to-be) world famous browser-based particle visualization platform [Firefly](github.com/ageller/Firefly). 

It is a submodule of Firefly, and updates recursively by default when that is pulled.
