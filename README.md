Firefly is an interactive viewer for any particle-based data. A live example is available [here](https://ageller.github.io/Firefly/)
or if you're ready to get started creating your own interactive viewer, [click here](https://ageller.github.io/Firefly/docs/build/html/data_reader/index.html).

If you use Firefly, please cite us using the [ADS listing](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ascl.soft10021G) that points to our Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) entry.

## Acknowledgments
Firefly is written in WebGL using the three.js library.
This tool builds off of a [previous version developed by Alessandro Febretti](https://github.com/nuitrcs/firefly). 

This project is funded by [Northwestern's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA)](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/),  [Northwestern's IT Research Computing group](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/index.html), and NSF grants AST-1412836, AST-1715216, and CAREER award AST-1652522 awarded to [Claude-André Faucher-Giguère](https://www.physics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core-faculty/claude-andre-faucher-giguere.html).


## Additional Info
Firefly was originally designed for [FIRE](http://galaxies.northwestern.edu/fire-simulations/) data, but has since been extended to support any particle data.
This package should not be confused with the serendipitously named web-based visualization software [Firefly, from Caltech-IPAC](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly), a general tool for retrieving and viewing astronomy data.
