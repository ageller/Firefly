This directory contains a `firefly.speck` file that can be used to build a frozen version of firefly (including all necessary python libraries) that can be run by simply double clicking.  I intended to use this with the electron app, but then I realized that this would not allow users to also open a jupyter notebook using the same python (or to install other packages).  I'm keeping it here for reference in case it's useful later.  See the `firefly.speck` file for more information.
